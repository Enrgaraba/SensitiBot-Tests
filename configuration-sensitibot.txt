---------------------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION FILE FOR SENSITIBOT
This file allows you to customize the behavior of SensitiBot.
You can define detection patterns, specify the types of files that the bot processes,
specify actions to take on detection, exclude specific content from being flagged,
specify the detection engine to use and customize the prompt that the bot will use.
Modify the settings below to suit your repository's needs.
The information in parentheses in the section titles indicates the name of 
the variable that must be written in the space for each configuration option. 
This variable must be followed by : and a space to enable the bot to identify it.
If any of the options is left blank, the bot will use the default parameters, 
which you can find in the project README.md.
IMPORTANT: Maintain the format and structure of this document at all times 
to ensure the bot functions correctly.
---------------------------------------------------------
PATTERNS (Pattern1)
Define the patterns that the bot will use to detect sensitive content.
Patterns must be written in JavaScript Regular Expression (regex) format.
Each pattern is associated with a label for easier identification. 
The pattern must be in this format 'Label': /regex/ 
Examples:
- 'Phone number': Detects phone numbers in the format "123 45 67 89".
- 'Email': Detects email addresses in standard formats.
Add or modify the patterns list as needed to suit your specific requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------
Pattern1: ['Phone number': /\b\d{3} \d{2} \d{2} \d{2}\b/]
Pattern2: ['Email': /\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b/]

---------------------------------------------------------
FILE TYPES (FileTypes)
Specify the types of files that the bot should analyze.
Use file extensions to define the file types.
Only files matching these extensions will be scanned for sensitive content.
The extensions supported at the moment are: .txt, .csv, .md, .json, .yaml and .yml
Add or modify the list as needed to suit your repository's requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------
FileTypes: ['txt', 'md', 'json']

---------------------------------------------------------
ACTIONS (OnDetection)
Define the actions the bot will take when sensitive content is detected.
Options:
- Alert: Creates an issue in the repository with details of the detected content.
- Block: Automatically removes the detected content in a Pull Request.
- Full: Performs both actions (Alert and Block).
Choose the action that best suits your workflow and security requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------
OnDetection: Alert

---------------------------------------------------------
EXCLUSIONS (Exclusions)
Specify a list of words, phrases, or patterns that the bot should ignore.
Even if these items match a detection pattern, they will be excluded from alerts or actions.
Use this section to whitelist specific content that is safe or expected in your repository.
This section does not apply to Gemini AI analysis.
---------------------------------------------------------
Exclusions: 

---------------------------------------------------------
TRUST BADGE (TrustBadge)
Choose whether to apply a vulnerability validation badge in the Pull Request creation functionality.
This badge will be placed at the beginning of documents that have been analyzed and modified by SensitiBot.
The badge will look like this: âœ… Validated by SensitiBot: No vulnerabilities found.
IMPORTANT: In the case of JSON files, the badge will be added as a property to the JSON structure.
Options:
- fullbadge: the badge will be placed in all analyzed and modified documents.
- nobadge: the badge will not be placed in any document.
- nojson: the badge will be placed in all files except those of type JSON.
If no option is chosen or the configuration is not used correctly, the default option "nojson" will be applied.
---------------------------------------------------------
TrustBadge: nojson

---------------------------------------------------------
DETECTION ENGINE (DetectionEngine)
Define which detection engine the bot should use.
This option only apply if the OnDetection option is in Alert or Full mode.
Options:
- patterns: Use traditional regex/pattern-based detection (default).
- gemini: Use Google Gemini AI for sensitive content detection (recommended for advanced analysis).

DISCLAIMER: Gemini AI's accuracy is relatively low on large files; for greater security, 
pattern-based detection is always preferable.
---------------------------------------------------------
DetectionEngine: gemini

---------------------------------------------------------
GEMINI PROMPT (GeminiPrompt)
Define a custom prompt for Gemini AI detection. You must use the variables:
- {type}: file type (e.g., txt, csv, md, json, yaml, yml)
- {content}: file content. This varianle is set to be located at the end of the prompt.
You must write the prompt in only one line. The following example is just to show how a 
good prompt should be written.

Example promt:

Analyze the following content from a file of type "${type}" and ONLY respond if you detect sensitive data.
If you detect anything, respond using exactly this Markdown format:

detected:

*   **Data type:** \`example found\` (brief explanation if applicable)
*   **Other type:** \`another example\` (brief explanation if applicable)
*   **Other type:** \`another example\` (brief explanation if applicable)

Where "Data type" should be the actual type of sensitive data detected 
(for example: phone numbers like 612 34 56 78, credit card numbers like 4111 5441 3111 1111, email addresses like usuario.ejemplo@gmail.com, bank accounts like 2100 0418 4502 0005 1332) 
and "example found" should be a real example of the data found in the content.

**You must enumerate ALL different types of sensitive data you find in the content, each on a separate line.**

**Do not omit any type of sensitive data. If there are several, list them all, even if they are of the same type but with different values.**

If there is nothing sensitive, respond exactly: No sensitive content detected.

Content:
${content}
